## Image Carousel
I created a simple image carousel with Javascript, and React.JS. You can add or remove as much images as you like by updating the array within the code. It is accessible and responsive on all devices.

## How does it work?
The images are listed on the website. Then the images with the "active" tag are only displayed. With the power of javascript functions, we can move that active tag around the images, which can be triggered by clicking the left and right buttons, and the indicators. The indicators are generated based on how many images are on the array, then each one has a function to select the images by its own index. The carousel automatically scrolls every 5 seconds, and for every action done on the carousel, the interval is reset.
